About me 👨‍💻

Hey there, my name is Moisés Centi but everyone calls me Marco, born in 2004 and studying a CS engineering, righ now I'd say i really enjoy creating UI and bringing those ideas to life, but i also enjoy working on backends, overall i got a better expertice on mobiles and webs, places where i can help bring those ideas to life.

Also enjoy learning with others and helping them understand better, thats why i decided to become a database administration assistant because one of the places where i shine is on databases.
